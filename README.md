# Swanky-Persona-Mods
This repository is meant to be an archive of sorts for the Persona video game mods that I have created and shared across different sites like ShrineFox.com and GameBanana.

The only mods that aren't present in this repository are my music mods. That is because they all have a pretty hefty size and cannot be uploaded to GitHub.
These are some external links for them:
